# Simulation-Supercapacitor-Charge-Discharge

The simulation is used to depict the behaviour of Charging and Discharging characteristic of Supercapacitor.
A Supercapacitor or an ultra capacitor is an electrochemical capacitor that has an unusually high energy density as compared to common capacitors. They serve storage of 10 to 100 times more energy per unit volume or mass than electrolytic capacitors, can accept and deliver charge much faster than batteries, and tolerate many more charge and discharge cycles than rechargeable batteries. They do not use the conventional solid dielectric of ordinary capacitors, instead of it, they use electrostatic double layer capacitance or electrochemical pseudo capacitance or a combination of both.

Hence they have desired qualities like charging up quickly like capacitors and storing huge amount of power like battery. But do not have drawback of battery like taking long time to charge to high power or drawback of a capacitor that stores less power quickly.

The Simulation shows the graph of the charging and discharging of Supercapacitor against time, along with how connections are made to setup the circuit.
